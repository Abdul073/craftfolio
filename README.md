## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdityaRai24/Craft-folio.git
cd Craft-folio
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

First, copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file in the root of your project.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, you'll need to fill in the values in the `.env` file. Here's how to get them:

-   **Clerk**: Go to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). Create a new application and navigate to the "API Keys" section.
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Use the "Publishable key".
    -   `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`: Use the "Secret key".
    - The sign-in and sign-up redirect URLs can be left as they are in the `.env.example` file.

-   **Cloudinary**: This is used for image uploads. Go to your [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console).
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: This is your "Cloud Name" found on the dashboard.
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_PRESET`: Go to Settings (gear icon) -> Upload. Find the "Upload presets" section and either use an existing one or create a new one. Copy the preset name.

-   **Google Gemini**: For AI features. Go to the [Google AI Platform](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
    -   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Create a new API key.

-   **Supabase**: This is for your database and storage.
    1.  Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.io/) and create a new project.
    2.  Once the project is ready, go to Connect Button in Navbar.
        -----  GO TO THE APP FRAME WORKS TAB. MAKE SURE FRAMEWORK IS SET TO NEXTJS.
        -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: This is the "Project URL".
        -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: This is the "Project API Key" (the `public` `anon` key).
        -----  GO TO THE ORMS TAB. MAKE SURE TOOL IS SET TO PRISMA.
        -   `DATABASE_URL`: DB URL
        -   `DIRECT_URL`: Direct url
    3. Copy and paste these 4 values in your .env file
    
### 4. Set Up the Database

Run the following commands to sync your schema with the database:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

After running these commands, go to the "Table Editor" in your Supabase project. You should see four new tables created.

### 5. Seed the Database

The project includes a SQL dump file with necessary initial data.

1.  Open the `db_dump.sql` file in the root of this project and copy its entire contents.
2.  In your Supabase project, navigate to the "SQL Editor".
3.  Paste the copied SQL into a new query and click "RUN".

### 6. Run the Development Server
